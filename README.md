## Current Projects

### ‚õ¥Ô∏è [Battleships Game](https://www.github.com/niallantony/battleships)

A web based battleships game.

#### Learning Objectives:
| Test Driven Development | This project from TheOdinProject was a way of learning TDD using Jest, building the mechanics of the game using a 'test first' approach. Getting familiarity with using mock functions and unit testing |
| Webpack | Further use of webpack, also learning how Webpack and TDD can work together. Trying to use Webpack in more advanced ways with each project |
| Responsive Design | One major objective of this project is to make it look and play well on mobile devices |

### üî¨ [Node Practice](www.github.com/niallantony/Node_practice)

A collection of small modules to work with different algorithms and data structures

#### Learning Objectives:
|Computer Science| Exploring data structures, algorithms and problems one might encounter in Computer Science |
| Creating a library | Enjoying maintaining an expandable library of different functions and modules that can be used in other projects |
| node.js practice | Experiencing back-end programming, which is eventually an area I want to concentrate in |

### [Element Library](https://github.com/niallantony/webpage-elements)

A collection of front-end web elements for use in other webpages

#### Learning Objectives:
| Libraries | Creating elements, organising them into a library and then reusing them in other projects is something I want to do consistently |
