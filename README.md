## 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

As well as continuously improving my web development skills with projects and mastering familiar tools, I am continually looking for new things to learn.
I have only recently started dipping into Python development, and intend to continue learning Python, with one of my short-term goals being the development of a web API using Django.
As part of my degree I have also been learning functional development with Haskell, and this is something that I am keen to keep working on.
