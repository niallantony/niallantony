## üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...

As part of my Computer Science degree I am constantly learning about the field of computer science. Working on coursework (that must not be uploaded to github) means I spend a large portion of my time with projects that I unfortunately cannot showcase. The areas I find most stimulating at the moment however include:
- AI and Machine Learning
- Functional Programming
- Databases

I hope to include some personal projects which build on these concepts soon, so watch this space.
As well as the above concepts I am constantly working on building my programming skills and am consistently strengthening my language skills in particular in Python and Javascript, but also C and Haskell.
